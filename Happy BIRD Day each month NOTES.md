<h1>BIRD NOTES //</h1>
I may switch all of the birds to primarily arboreal in nature. Although I like drawing cassowaries, it will be hard to match them with the theme of the website itself. LOOK INTO THIS, you can try to just match the style of the images to match the background, regardless of the difference in country or aviary families.
<br>

<br>
<h3>TRY TO BE UNIQUE WITH BIRD CHOOSING.</h3> Great you put in a tiny flying songbird with slight color alterations, want a medal? There are numerous families for the aviary species: Pigeons/doves, owls, sea birds, flightless birds, pheasants, songbirds, crows/ ravens, game birds, and so on. DO KEEP IN MIND that some of them may also be in the same family, but look completely different for some reason (Ex. crows & blue jays, etc.)
<br>

<br>
<h3>DO NOT generalize the species. </h3> (EX. Hawk vs Red-tailed Hawk)... I want to make unique concepts… But don’t make it too unique, I don’t think people are that special. Take the Potoo bird for example. I looked up its family and I really shouldn't have. You want the user to remember your website, yes, but not in such a morally incorrect manner when looking into the eyes of a Potoo bird and associating its existence with the month they were born into.
<br>

<br>
<h3>Take the general association of the month’s personality to a bird that has a similar personality.</h3> If June is a warm, curious and adventurous bird that relies too much on fun, pick a sun conure… maybe you can make it funny. Those born in August are apparently known for being confident and charismatic. Someone may think they will become a cool bald eagle due to this personality trait. Bald eagles are confident and charismatic… but so are Peacocks.
<br>

<br>
<h3>Every bird seems to have their own unique traits. Possibly include these facts too!</h3>
<br>

<h3>BIRDS I REALLY LIKE AND WANT TO INCLUDE…</h3> if their personality does not match the month, however, remove them or possibly swap them for one that does. <b>KEEP IN MIND you do need some monochromatic/ minutely interesting birds here and there. If you make every single bird the center of attention it might overwhelm the user.</b>
<br>

<br>
<b>Bearded vulture</b> - mysterious, resourceful, resilient; also they look very cool and enjoyable to draw
<br>

<br>
<b>Mandarin duck</b> - a possible replacement to the swan, as both correlate to Valentines day, just in different countries. A bit harder to draw, but very unique
<br>

<br>
<b>Canadian goose</b> - nothing special with them, but I do really hate them. I still have faint leg damage protecting my dog from their aggressive antics. These birds are the root to all evil. (Possibly make the eyes red)
<br>

<br>
<b>Black-capped conure</b> - I have one. He told me he would bite me if I didn’t include him.
<br>

<br>
<b>ANY OWL SPECIES</b> - Try to add one that isn’t too too interesting (great grey owl may be a little too much) This species already has a rotatable head, an eye socket 50-70% of their skull, and 20% of their body dedicated to their skull…
<br>

<br>
<b>LONG LEGGED BIRDS</b> - Most likely herons/ cranes, etc. This adds a bit of uniqueness without a mandatory/ overbearing color palette.
